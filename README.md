# 🏗 Make One Yourself

## 1. Duplicate this repository
  You can clone this repo to your account.

## 2. Set it up on your local machine

  ```
git clone https://github.com/your-nickname/some-repository.git
  # this clone link is from the repo that you generated at the previous step!

cd some-repository
  # move to your newly cloned folder

yarn
  # to install dependencies
  # of course, you can use npm
  # - but just be sure to delete yarn.lock

yarn dev
  # run the dev server in your local environment
  ```

## 3. Setup Deployment
   My go to platform for hosting is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). But you can use whatever you like. Just make sure to build first.
   
   
## 4. Configurations
  Now go through the files and customize to your liking! 😁
